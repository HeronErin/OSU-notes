 $$ W = F_{avr}x$$
## Potential energy
The work done by a conservative force corresponds an equal and opposite cchange in potential energy U.
$$ W_c = -\Delta U$$
And the change in gravitation potential energy is
$$ \Delta U =  - (-mgh) = mgh $$
## kinetic energy

$$ W = a \Delta x = \frac 1 2 mv^2 $$

**This is the kinetic energy of the object**
Work - Kinetic energy theorem 
$$ W_{total}​=ΔKE=ΔPE+W_f​ $$


Conservative force: Path independent  (Ex: Gravity, Spring, Electrostatic)
		Change in [[#Potential energy]]
Non-Conservative force: Path  matters (Ex: friction, Drag, Rockets)
	Change in [[#"Internal Energy"]]

Springs

**Work on spring:**
Anti derivative of kx is
$$ w = \frac 1 2 kx^2\ (\ +\ C) $$
$$ F = kx_0 $$
Where c is final minus initial
**Work by spring**
$$ w = -\frac 1 2 k x_0^2 $$
**conservative**

$$ F = - \frac {dU} {Dx} $$
Gravity:
$$ U = mgy $$
Friction:
$$ Wf_​=−F_f​d $$

## Conservation of energy
Energy is not created or destroyed
- Can change form
- Can enter or leave a system
System: A collection of objects of interest
$$ W_C = - \Delta U$$
$$ E_{TOTAL} = K + U - E_{int} $$
$$ E_{TOT} = TRANSFERS\ in\ or\ out\ of\ system$$
Get in the habit of writing:
$$ \Delta K + \Delta U + \Delta E_{INT} = W + Q + T_o$$


where U is potential energy within a system
where Q is heat transfer
where T_0 is other
where W is the force **added** into the system!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# "Internal Energy"
**New category of energy**
* Kinetic  and potential Energy of the internal molecules!
* Exists without measurable displacement
$$ W_{NC} = -\Delta E_{inc}$$
- Within a system
_______________
# Momentum
A **vector** quantity! And also conserved! (We can't step out of the universe and apply forces to it)
$$ \bar P = m\bar v $$
$$ \Sigma \bar F = \frac {d\bar p}{dt}$$
$$ d\bar p = \Sigma \bar f dt\ -> constant\ force\ -> \Delta \bar p = \Sigma \bar F\Delta t$$
Impulse = force over time
$$ \Delta \bar p = \bar F \Delta t $$

But also:
$$ F = VM $$
Where the force is COMPLETELY OPPOSING THE MOMENTUM!
_____________________
$$ m\bar v = \Sigma \bar F \Delta t $$
____________________
## Isolated system
Nothing going in or out of a system
$$ \Delta k + \Delta U = \Delta E_{int} = 0 $$
$$ \Delta p = \Sigma \bar F \Delta t = 0 $$
Unlike energy it **only includes** movement. So only force matters

No non conservatives = no e
The earth is in the system so NO WORK

$$ \Delta K + \Delta U = 0$$
$$ K_f - K_i + U_f - U_i = 0 $$
$$ \frac 1 2 mv_f^2 - 0 + 0 -mgh = 0 $$
$$ \frac 1 2 v_f^2 -gh = 0 $$
$$ \frac 1 2 v_f^2  = gh $$
$$ v_f  = \sqrt{2gh} $$

Ex2:

Two children stand on a platform at the top of a curving slide next to a backyard swimming pool. At the same moment the smaller child hops off to jump straight down into the pool, the bigger child releases herself at the top of the frictionless slide.

In a system containing the earth the slide and the kid

dK + dU + <strike>dE </strike>= <strike>W + Q+ T</strike>
dk + dU = 0
$$ K_f - K_i + U_f - U_i = 0$$
$$ 0.5mv_f^2 - 0 + 0 - mgh = 0$$$$ v_f  = \sqrt{2gh} $$
Ex3:
Object falls onto the spring, where does it momentarly come to rest?
At what X is v=0?

Coordinate system: Top of spring!
System: Block, earth, spring


Spring is conservative, so is gravity
Final kenetic energy is zero
Final **potential energy** is the hardest to find
$$ U_f = \frac 1 2 mx_0^2 + mgx_0 $$
$$ \Delta K + \Delta U = 0 $$
$$ U_f - U_i = \frac 1 2 mx_0^2 + mgx_0 - mgh = 0 $$
$$ x = \frac {-b +- \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

$$ U_f - U_i = \frac 1 2 mx_0^2 + mgx_0 - mgh = 0 $$
$$ x_0 = \frac {-mg +- \sqrt{(mg)^2 - 4 \frac 1 2 m(-mgh)}}{2 \frac 1 2 m} $$
a=0 
Ex 3:

$$ dW = \bar F * \bar{dr} = Ndr\ cos90 = 0 $$
Q 13:
$$ w = mgh $$
$$ P = \frac {dw}{dt} = \frac w {\Delta t} $$
Q 9:\
$$ W_c = - \Delta U $$
$$ W_{NC} = - \Delta E_{int} $$

$$ \Delta E_{int} -W_{NC} = -W_f = -(-fd)  = fd$$
$$ k_{f}-k_{i}+u_{f}-u_{i} + fd=0 $$
$$ 0-\frac 1 2 mv_i^2 +\frac 1 2 kd^2-0 + fd=0 $$
