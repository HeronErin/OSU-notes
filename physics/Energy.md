## Potential energy
The work done by a conservative force corresponds an equal and opposite cchange in potential energy U.
$$ W_c = -\Delta U$$
And the change in gravitation potential energy is
$$ \Delta U =  - (-mgh) = tmgh $$
## kinetic energy

$$ W = a \Delta x = \frac 1 2 mv^2 $$
**This is the kinetic energy of the object**
Work - Kinetic energy theorem 
Conservative force: Path independent  (Ex: Gravity, Spring, Electrostatic)
Non-Conservative force: Path  matters (Ex: friction, Drag, Rockets)
__________
Springs

**Work on spring:**
Anti derivative of kx is
$$ w = \frac 1 2 kx^2\ (\ +\ C) $$
Where c is final minus initial
**Work by spring**
$$ w = -\frac 1 2 k x_0^2 $$
**conservative**

$$ F = - \frac {dU} {Dx} $$
Gravity:
$$ U = mgy $$

## Conservation of energy
Energy is not created or destroyed
- Can change form
- Can enter or leave a system
