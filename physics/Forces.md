Force: Concepts of pulling or pushing on something
Contact forces: Forces btwn two objects that are touchin g or connected
Field Forces: Act "At a Distance"
	- Gravity
	- Electromagnetic Forces
		- Typically don't care about
	- Nuclear Forces (strong, weak)
		-Don't care about
Contact forces are actually field forces at insanely short ranges. (Atoms and shit)
_____________
The force on a spring is preportional to the amount streched
$$ F_s=-k\Delta x $$
where k is the spring constant "stiffness"
**'Hooks law'** - Ideal spring
Spring wants to restore itself to original position
<center><b>Linear restoring force</b></center>
Lots of things act like springs, ex atoms in a molecule;
<u>Gravity</u> exerts a force on the block proportional to the mass. 
________________
### Frame of reference.  Like a coordinate system
An inertial frame of reference is one where an object is <u>not</u> interacting with any other objects experiences zero acceleration. 
- <u>Non-accelerating</u>
Examples: classroom, car with const speed
Non examples: Plane taking off, car turning

In an inertial frame of reference an object with no force on it has zero acceleration.

_____________
-Force adds component wise
-Acceleration proportional to sum of forces(net forces)
-Inverse to mass
Vector statement
$$ a = \frac {F_{net}}m$$
$$ \Sigma \bar F $$
Sum of all <u>forces</u>. [[Newton#Newton II]]
$$ \Sigma \bar F = M\bar A$$
Force is that which causes acceleration.

$$ -F_g = mg $$
[[Newton#Newton III]] Interacting objects exert an equal and opposite forces on each over.
$$ F_{AB} = -F_{BA} $$
-------------------
The white lie: Work = Force "times" distance

## Only the displacement **parallel** to force counts toward the work
W = F delta R
Otherwise 
$$ W = f\Delta R\ cos \theta$$Special cases:
* Force parallel to displacement
	* W = F delta R
* Perpendicular
	* zero
* Opposite direction
	* W = - F delta R


WORK LACKS COMPONENTS
Scalar product = Dot product
Vector  =>  Scalar 
$$ \bar A * \bar B =  ABcos\theta = A_xB_x + A_yB_y$$
