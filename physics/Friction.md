Contact force <u>parallel</u> to surfaces.
	Interaction of surface textures / materials
	2 kinds:
		1. Kinetic (sliding) $$ f_k = \mu_kN $$ 
			opposing the sliding, 
	$$ N = mgcos\Theta$$
	$$ f_k = mg\mu_kcos\Theta $$
		2.  Static (no sliding)
			Whatever is necessary to prevent sliding with the condition that $$ f_s <= \mu_sN $$
			Where mu<sub>s</sub> is the coefficient of static friction.
	But we don't know which we are using, so first assume static friction and solve for f<sub>s</sub> then see if the condition is true. 
		If so we are done,
		 otherwise kinetic friction wins, rewrite with kinetic instead of static. 
		 $$ a = \frac {v^2}R $$
		$$ f_s = \frac {mv^2}R$$
		$$ V_{MAX} = \sqrt {m_sgR} $$
