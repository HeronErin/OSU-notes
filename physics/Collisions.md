Interactions between two (or more) objects with no outside influences (**During the collision**)



Kinds of collisions
- Perfectly inelastic
	- Objects stick together (Or move together)
	- Some energy is lost via noise
		- Not 'locally' conserved
		- k + u + e = w + q + t where **t != 0**
		- **Energy BUT NOT momentum!**
	- Equal final velocities: $$ m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2} = (m_1+m_2)v_f $$
	- Assert no total momentum change
	-
