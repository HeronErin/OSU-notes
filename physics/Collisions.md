Interactions between two (or more) objects with no outside influences (**During the collision**)



Kinds of collisions
- Perfectly inelastic
	- Objects stick together (Or move together)
	- Some energy is lost via noise
		- Not 'locally' conserved
		- k + u + e = w + q + t where **t != 0**
		- **Energy BUT NOT momentum!**
	- Equal final velocities: $$ m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2} = (m_1+m_2)v_f $$
	- Assert no total momentum change
- Perfectly Elastic
	- Kinetic energy is conserved
		- K<sub>i</sub> = K<sub>f</sub> $$ \frac 1 2 m_1v_{i1}^2 + \frac 1 2 m_2v_{i2}^2 = \frac 1 2 m_1v_{f1}^2 + \frac 1 2 m_2v_{f2}^2 $$
		- Momentum is conserved (as always)

Ex:

1. 
	Railcar coasting underneath conveyor gravel drops into car.

$$ V_0 = 2.4 \frac ms $$
$$ m_1= 35,000kg $$
$$ m_2= 52,000kg $$


$$ v_{f}=\frac{m_{1}v_{i1}+m_{2}v_{i2}}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)} = 0.965517241379\ m/s $$
2. 3 diff ways, perf elastic, inelastic, and inbetween where *3m hits m at rest*
   a) Inelastic (they stick)
	   -Cons of momentum
   
	   $$ v_f = 3/4 * v_i $$
   b)  Elastic (they bounce)
	   - Cons of momntum
	   - Const of KE
	   $$ P_i = P_f $$$$ 3mv_0 = 2mv_1+v_2 $$
	   $$ k_i=K_f\ ->\ =\frac 1 2 (2m)v_0^2 = \frac 1 2 (2m)v_1^2 + \frac 1 2 mv_2^2$$
	   $$ 3v_0=3v_i+v_2\ -> v_1 = v_0 - \frac 1 3 v_2$$
	   $$ 3v_0 = 3v_i^2+v_2^2\ ->\ v_1^2 = v_0-\frac 1 3 v_2^2$$
	   Solve for v_2
	   $$ \frac 1 9 v_2^2 + \frac 1 3 v_2^2 - \frac 2 3 v_iv_2  = 0$$
	   $$ v_2(\frac 4 9 v_2 - \frac 2 3 v_0)  = 0$$
	   v_2 is zero when no colision
	   $$ \frac 4 3 v_2 - \frac 2 3 v_0 = 0$$
	   
	$$ v_2 = \frac 3 2 v_0 $$
	   $$ v_1 = v_0 - \frac 1 3 v_2 = v_0 - \frac 1 3 (\frac 3 2 v_0) = \frac 1 2 v_0 $$$$ = \frac 12 8 mv_0^2 = \frac 3 2 mv^2 $$
