Direction defined with right hand rule: Take your right hand, curl your fingers, thumb = direction facing
## Torque
$$ \tau = r F_t = rFsin\Theta$$
$$ \bar \tau = \bar r * \bar F$$
**NOTE THE BAR!**
two vectors into one vector - "Cross product". 
$$ \bar A * \bar B = ABsin\phi$$
$$ (\bar B * \bar A) \ne (\bar A * \bar B) $$
$$ (\bar B * \bar A) = -(\bar A * \bar B) $$



Morse distance = more torque

Recall work
$$ w = \bar F * \Delta \bar r cos\Theta$$
