## Ideal gas
Similar to: [[Fluid Dynamics]]

Simplified modal of gases (Ie room temp air)
	Gas molecules don't interact with one another
		Low density
	Ignore the container or **any** other forces
	The molecules uniformly fill the container
$$ PV = nRT $$
	n is the amount of gas in moles
	R is the constant (8.314 J/mole)
	Sometimes written as $$ PV=NkT $$
	Where N is amount of and k is Boltzmann constant
## Thermodynamic work
$$ dW = Pdv$$
$$\Delta E_{int} =W+Q $$
## Moles
Amount that can **roughly** fit in your hand
$$ N_a = 6.02*10^{23} $$
**Avogadros's NUMBER**
	1g of hydrogen
	$$ N = m/M $$
	He has a molor mass of 4.003 g/mol

## Temperature
Hotter object higher temperature
* True except for some states of matter
**Thermal equilibrium** = Two objects do **NOT** exchange temp
		Objects without equilibrium attempt to become a state of equilibrium
	Same temperature
## Measuring temperature
Most commonly the volume of a liquid
	* Also volume of a gas, and pressure of gas
	* Or Electrical resistance
		* Can't Fit a foot of Hg in a cpu
	* Or color
**MOST FORMULAS NEED KELVIN!**

## Kelvin
Relative to absolute zero.
Celsius -273
## Fahrenheit
Ice = 32F
Steam  = 212
$$ T_f = \frac 95T_c+32$$
$$ T_c = \frac 95(T_f - 32) $$
## Thermal expansion

**SMALL** **EXPANSIONS** ONLY:
$$ \frac {\Delta L}L = \alpha\Delta T$$
$$ \Delta L = \alpha L\Delta T$$
* Alpha is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion. (Unit C^-1, K^-1)
* Different for each material
* All dimensions at once
	* X, Y, and Z
	* Uniform expansion

For solids a ~ 10<sup>-5</sup> to 100<sup>^6</sup>
For liquids 10<sup>-6</sup>

### Water
However water is strange and increases in size as it cools

## Foil approximation 
For x < 1
$$ (1+x)^3 \approx 1+3x $$
