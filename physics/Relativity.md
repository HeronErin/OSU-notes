$$ x' = \gamma (x-vt)$$
$$ x = \gamma(x' + vt') $$
If zero time displacement
$$ \Delta x = \frac{\Delta x}\gamma $$
$$ t = \gamma(t-\frac{xv}{c^2}) $$
$$ t = \gamma(t'+\frac{vx'}{c^2}) $$

U is the moving object, V is the speed between frames of reference
$$ u' = \frac{u-v}{1-\frac{uv}{c^2}} $$
$$ u = \frac{u'+v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}} $$


If zero displacement:
$$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 $$
Spacetime distance
$$ D = \sqrt{c^2\Delta t^2 - (\Delta x^2\Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2)}$$
$$ \gamma = \frac1{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v}{c})^2}}$$

## Event
A point in space, instant in time, point in space time.
# Lorentz Transformations
Equations at header. Also work for deltas
## "Proper" time
Time where an event occurs.  **SHORTEST TIME**

## "Proper" length
Length where an event occurs. **LONGEST TIME**

> Spacecraft I, containing students taking a physics exam, approaches the Earth with a speed of 0.640_c_ (relative to the Earth), while spacecraft II, containing professors proctoring the exam, moves at 0.260_c_ (relative to the Earth) directly toward the students. The professors stop the exam after 60.0 min have passed on their clock.

> (a) For what time interval (in minutes) does the exam last as measured by the students?

Events: PROFs start their clock, and end the clock
	PROFs are proper as they are the ones who make the events.




Anybody else if timing will get a *dilated* time (LONGER)
> (b) For what time interval (in minutes) does the exam last as measured by an observer on Earth?

$$ \Delta t_e = \gamma_{ep} \Delta t_0 $$
$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(0.26)^{2}}} \simeq  1.03561627667$$
