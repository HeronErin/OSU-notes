[[Energy]] is not conserved with special relativity, so we need relativistic energy
## Momentum
[[Energy#Momentum]]
$$ \bar p = \gamma mv $$
THE v is the same v for gamma
## Rest energy
$$ E_0 = mc^2 $$
## Total energy
$$ E_{tot} = E_0 + K = \gamma mc^2 $$
## Kinetic energy
$$ k = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 $$
