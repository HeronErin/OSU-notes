# Newton I
An inertial frame of reference is one where an object is <u>not</u> interacting with any other objects experiences zero acceleration. 
- <u>Non-accelerating</u>
Examples: classroom, car with const speed
Non examples: Plane taking off, car turning
In an inertial frame of reference an object with no force on it has zero acceleration.
## Newton II
Must find a coordinate system
$$ \Sigma F = ma $$
$$  \Sigma F = \frac {d\bar p}{d t}\ \ ; \ \ \bar p = m\bar v $$
**The force vector is always the hypotenuse**
## Newton III
The force exherted on one object is exherted inversely to the opposing object. 

$$ F_{21} = - F_{12} $$
