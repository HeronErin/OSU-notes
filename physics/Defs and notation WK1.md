### Prelab: Intro, 1-D Kinematics:
Just read the instructions

# Day 2
- Any coord system aslong as axiis are perpendicular. 
- Displacment = diff in pos
	$$ P_1 - P_2 $$
	$$ \Delta X = X_F - X_I $$
- FOR NOW NUMBER LINE
- Rate of change is with respect to something
- BAR = AVERAGE
$$ \bar v = \frac {\Delta x} {\Delta t} $$
* Tangent line = touches but does not cross
* Slope = rate of change
* derivative = Instant rate of change  
$$ \bar a = \frac {\Delta v} {\Delta t} $$
^2 = second order derivative = Jerk
$$ \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac {\Delta v} {\Delta t} = \frac {dv} {dt} = \frac {d^2x} {dt^2} $$
- **SPEED** != velocity
	- The rate distance is traversed
	- Also magnitude of velocity
		- Somewhat equivalent to abs in 1-D
 $$gravity = 9.8 \frac {m} {s^2} $$
 * Aceleration at constant rate
	 $$\bar a = a$$
	 $$ a = \frac {\Delta V} {\Delta t} \to \Delta v = at $$
	 * delta v is the **area** of under graph
$$ \Delta v = v_f - v_i \to v_f=v_i + \Delta v $$
$$ v_f - v_i = at $$
$$ v_f = v_i + at$$
		* **SLOPE OF MAX = 0 AND MIN = 0**
# Day 3

* **Express gravity as G downwards** so g = 9.8
	* Can't assign a sign when lacking a coordinate system
Expanded upon in: [[Universal Gravity]]
## With a constant acceleration the following apply:

$$\Delta v = at $$$$ \Delta x = v_it + 0.5 (\Delta t)(a\Delta t) = 0.5 a(\Delta t)^2 +v_i\Delta t$$
### Without time
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \Delta x $$
### The big three equations for constant acc
$$  \Delta x =  0.5a\Delta t^2 + v_it $$
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \Delta x $$

$$\Delta v = at $$
Also: $$ \Delta x = 0.5(v_f+v_i)t $$
