Force per unit area F / A
$$ \sigma = F/A $$
This course is mostly rigid objects with one exception: **the spring**
And that's because its simple: f = kx
## Pressure
Atmospheric pressure: ~14 lb / in<sup>2</sup>, ~30 inHg(mercury)
	Metric units ~101, 300 Pa
	


## Pascals
Newtons per meter squared, one newton is one apple, a meter is large, so it is **quite small**

## Elastic deformation
It comes back, everything is a spring!!!! (If we restrict the world to springs)

## Strain
actual deformation as a fraction of its original length. 
$$ \epsilon = \frac {\Delta L}L $$
ITS UNIT-LESS BOISSS
### Young modulus
unit: giga pascals: GPa
$$ y = \frac \epsilon\sigma  = \frac{\text{stress}}{\text {strain}}$$
Slope of stress over strain
'Stiffness'
Like a spring constant, you look it up
