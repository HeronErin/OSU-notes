An airplane flies straight for 640 km/hr. Then changes to 700 km /hr for 50 min. If the average speed is 680 km /hr. What is the duration of the entire trip? 

Treat as two seperate equations. The only useful equations in
$$ \Delta x = 0.5 at^2 + v_it $$
With a = 0
$$ \Delta_1 = v_1t_1 $$
$$ \Delta_2 = v_2t_2 $$
Unknowns: d1, t1, d2:
Average vel = dx / dt
$$
 \bar v = \frac {\Delta_1 + \Delta_2} {t_1 + t_2} $$
 THE PHYSICS IS DONE!
 $$\bar v = \frac {v_1t_1 + v_2t_2} {t_1 + t_2} $$
 Mult by denominator:
 $$\bar v(t_1 + t_2) - v_1t_1 - = v_2t_2 $$

L starts at rest. Accel is 3.4 m/s^2
S starts from rest 140m ahead of L and accel 2.9 m/s^2
1. Write an equation for L's pos as a func of time
$$ x_f - x_i = \Delta x = 0.5 at^2 $$
$$ x_f  = 0.5 at^2 + x_i  $$
$$ x_f  = 0.5 at^2  $$
2. Write eq for S as a function of time
$$ x_f  = 0.5 at^2 + x_i  $$
3. Combine
$$  0.5a_st^2 + x_{is} = 0.5 a_Lt^2 $$

A cubic foot of osmium is the densest metal, is 1410 pounds. Calculate the maxx of a cubic inch in kilograms (1 pound = 0.454 kg, 1ft = 12 in)
$$ p = (\frac {1410 lb} {1ft^3}) (\frac {1 ft} {12in}) ^3 \frac {.454kg} {1 lb} = .37 kg $$

## Vectors
ordered pairs
Components = Components
$$ magnitude = \sqrt {x^2 + y^2} $$
(in 2d)
$$ \frac {a_y}{a_x} = tan \Theta $$
*you do **not** need a coord system for angles and to normalize*
A vector is an array of numbers. With component-wise addition and scalar multiplication (multi one number with each element)

$$ a_x = a cos\Theta $$
$$ a_y = a sin\Theta $$
$$ a = \sqrt {a_x^2 + a_y^2} $$
Rectangular to polar coordinates; (a, theta) **ARE NOT COMPONENTS**
$$ a = \sqrt {a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} $$
3d TRIG is messy and too complicated for this course.

A **unit vector** is a vector of magnitude 1; aka normalized vectors. 

$$ \hat V  = Unit\ Vector$$
$$ \hat I = (1, 0),\ \hat J = (0, 1) $$
$$ \hat I = (1, 0),\ \hat J = (0, 1) $$
k for 3d as well


Mult-ing vecs
$$ (2, 3) = 2\hat I = 3\hat J $$
This becomes a collection of terms... great
can apparently be used to convert coord systems.
