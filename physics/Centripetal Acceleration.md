$$ a = v^2 / r  $$
$$ f = \frac {mv^2}r$$
With radians:
$$ arclen = r \Theta $$
$$ v = freq\ *\ 2\pi r $$
Ex:
A satalight is 250 km above earth at 7.82 km/s. What is the centeripetal acceleration?
$$ \frac{\left(7.83\cdot1000\right)^{2}}{\left(250+6370\right)\cdot1000} = 9.26116314199\ m/s^2 $$

The basic unit of movement is velocity. Unless acted upon by outside force vel stays the same.
##### Ramp stuff
When sliding the car down the hill with a slight incline the accel is const
Otherwise increasing

When dropping the ball accel is 9.8.
