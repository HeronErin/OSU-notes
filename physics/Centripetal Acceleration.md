$$ a = v^2 / r  $$
$$ f = \frac {mv^2}r$$
With radians:
$$ arclen = r \Theta $$
$$ v = freq\ *\ 2\pi r $$

$$ a_t = ra$$
where a_t is tangential acc and a is angular

Ex:
A satalight is 250 km above earth at 7.82 km/s. What is the centeripetal acceleration?
$$ \frac{\left(7.83\cdot1000\right)^{2}}{\left(250+6370\right)\cdot1000} = 9.26116314199\ m/s^2 $$

The basic unit of movement is velocity. Unless acted upon by outside force vel stays the same.
##### Ramp stuff
When sliding the car down the hill with a slight incline the accel is const
Otherwise increasing

When dropping the ball accel is 9.8.

Point on a rotating object
$$ F_T = ma_T = mR\alpha$$
(with 90* angle) $$ F_T = mR_T $$
$$ \Sigma \tau = mR^2\bar\alpha$$
$$ \Sigma \tau = I\bar\alpha$$

where s = distance traveled
$$ s = R \theta $$
$$ v = R\omega $$
$$ a = R\alpha $$
## Moment of rotational inertia
$$ I = mR^2 $$
inertia = amount object resists forces
Solid sphere:
$$ I - \frac 2 5 m R^2 $$
WE DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT INTEGRALS FOR THIS CLASS
