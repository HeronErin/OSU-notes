Microstate: What is happening with each molecule
Macrostate: P, V, T, n being all emergent properties from many molecules 
	Many microstates => one macrostate 
	
Entropy is the **measurement of the macrostate**
$$ S = K_b ln \Omega $$
$$ K_b = \text {Boltzman constant} $$
$$ \Omega = \text{Number of microstates} $$
$$ dS = \frac {dQ}T\ \ \ \to \ \ \ \Delta s = \int \frac{dQ}T $$
$$ dS_h = \frac {-dQ}{T_h} $$
$$ dS_c = \frac {dQ}{T_c} $$
$$ \Delta s = mc\cdot ln(\frac {T_2} {T_1})$$

Entropy of cold object increases 
Entropy of hot object decreases more than the  entropy of cold object decreases
The entropy of the universe **always increases** (Second law of [[Thermodynamics]])


$$ \Delta S = nRln\frac {V_f}{V_i} $$

As shown in the figure below, 3.00 moles of H2 gas is contained in the left side of a container. The two sides of the container are separated by a valve, and both sides are equal in volume. The right side of the container is initially evacuated.![[Screenshot_20241118_103444.png]]
NO WORK IS DONE HERE, NO HEAT IS TRANSFERRED.

A spacecraft with a proper length of 350 m passes by an observer on the Earth. According to this observer, it takes 0.800 µs for the spacecraft to pass a fixed point. Determine the speed of the spacecraft as measured by the Earth-based observer.

$$ \frac{L_0}\gamma = v\Delta t $$
$$ \frac{L_{0}^{2}}{dt^{2}+\frac{L_{0}^{2}}{c^{2}}}=v^{2} $$
