# Equations
$$ m = pv $$
$$ f = \rho V g $$

# Fluid
Randomly moving particles
Types:
- Liquid
	- Moves within fluid, but can't escape
	- Gravity makes it take shape of container
	- Treat as incompressible
- Gas
	- Fills its container on all sides
		- Gravity doesn't matter
	- Compressible
	- Not closely bound
- Other
	- corn
# Density
Mass per unit volume
$$ p = \frac m V $$
Gas is about 10<sup>-3</sup>
Metals are about 10<sup>1</sup> water
Rocks are about 10<sup>1</sup> water

# Pressure
See: [[Stress#Pressure]]
Force per unit volume measured in [[Stress#Pascals]]
Pressure is perpendicular to surface

$$ F = PA $$
$$ P =\frac F  A $$
$$ P = P_\text{surface} + \rho gh$$
If not moving the pressure at the surface is atmospheric 
# Gauge pressure
Subtract atmospheric. ITS THE **DIFFERENCE**
$$ P_\text{gauge} = P_\text{abs} - P_\text{atm} $$
# Pascals Law
Adding pressure to a liquid adds to the pressure uniformly 

## Hydraulic principle
Small piston with small area is easier to move than  big piston with big area, so car go up.

$$ A_1\Delta x_1 = A_2\Delta x_2 $$
$$ F_1\Delta x_1 = f_2\Delta x_2 $$
