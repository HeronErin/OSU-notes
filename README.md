## College notes

Notes for for college classes taken in obsidian. The obsidian to html converter seems to suck with LaTeX, and even with a [custom cleanup tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeronErin/obsidian-html-fix/refs/heads/main/fix.py) added to the build script some LaTeX issues persist. Plus my notes are a complete **mess!**
