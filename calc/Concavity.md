## Concave up
If `f'' > 0` (double [[Derivatives]] pos), concave UP (facing up)

## Concave down
if `f'' < 0`(double  [[Derivatives]] neg), concave down (facing down)
## Inflection point
An inflection point is an x-value in the domain of f where the sense of concavity changes. And where second derivative changes sign
