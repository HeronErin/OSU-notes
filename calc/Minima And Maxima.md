**Must be on a domain, or else known as a *endpoint maxima/minima***
F(x) has a defined maxima at x=a if:
1. x is in an open interval I=(b, c) contained in the domain f
2. f(x) <= f(a)for all x in I



## Extreme tests
$$ f'(x) = 0\ \ OR\ = DNE $$
Not 100% accurate
## Critical points
x = a is called a critical point, fn f if x is in inter of the domain of f and passes tests. 
Aka anything special, ex tan lines

## Fermants

If f is differentiable at a and f has a local extreme at x = a THEN the derivative = 0
## Conclusion

If f has a local exteme at x = a, then either f'(a) = 0 or f'(a) = DNE

derivative MUST CHANGE SIGN

## Derivative tests
1.
1. f'(x) goes from pos to neg. Local max at x
2. f'(x) goes from neg to pos, Local min
2.
	**Sign of Second Derivative**: If the second derivative is positive, the critical point is a local minimum. If the second derivative is negative, the critical point is a local maximum. If the second derivative is zero, the test is inconclusive.
## Extreme value theorem
If f is continuous on \[a, b], then f has a global maximum value and a global minimum value on \[a, b]
