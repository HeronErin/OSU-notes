## What an integral is

$$ \int^F_IV(t)dt =  X(F) - X(I)$$


## First
$$ \frac d{dt}(\int^t_aV(z)dz) =  X(F) - X(I) = X'(F) - 0 = v(t) $$
INTEGRAL STARTING AT A FIXED VALUE IS AN ANTI DERIVATIVE


Theorem: If you define a function with the argument being the upper limit of an integral, the derivative of this function IS the thing being integrated.
