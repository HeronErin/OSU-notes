$$ \lim_{x\to x}f(x) = L$$
If the values of f can be made as close as *you like* to L for all x sufficiently close to but not equal to, a ("Two-sided" limit)
_______________________
$$ \lim_{x\to 3+}f(x) = L$$
One sided limit, approaching for the positive towards the negative. 
# Limit Laws
1. Arithmatic
2. Composition:  if f is continuous as m and g is continuous as m $$ \lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = \lim_{x -> \to a} f(\lim_{x \to a} g(x)) = f(m) $$
3.  Squeezing $$ \lim_{x \to 2} ln(sin(x-2) + e^x*sin(\frac {\pi x}{4})) = ln(\lim_{x \to 2} (sin(x-2) + e^x*sin(\frac {\pi x}{4}))) \ \ ;\ etc $$
5. All famous functions are continuous on their domain.
